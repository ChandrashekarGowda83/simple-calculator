Calculator App

A simple yet stylish calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with a clean theme for a better user experience.

How to Run

Open VS Code (or any code editor of your choice).

Create three files:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Copy the respective code into each file.

Save the files in the same folder.

Open index.html in your browser (you can right-click and choose "Open with Live Server" if you have the Live Server extension in VS Code).

Thatâ€™s it ðŸŽ‰ â€” your calculator app is ready to use!
